All the code that I developed for the project to work

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SMART CONTRACT IS ON THE FILE vWorld.sol not RemixVWorld.sol and the deployment script is in interaction.js

It is not uploaded in github, but note that I also sent a word file with the deployment data and security vulnerability analysis to RJ.
